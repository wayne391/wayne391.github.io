Hi! I’m Wen-Yi Hsiao (wayne391).

I specialize in Multimedia Research and Engineering.   
specifically, they are Music, Audio, Digital Signal Processing, and Computer Vision.    
* As a **Researcher**, I've published over 10 [publications]() with more than 1,1k citations.  
* As an **Engineer**, I’ve contributed several [projects]() to GitHub, earning over 2.5k stars.  

I received my B.S. & M.S. in Computer Science from [National Tsing Hua University](https://www.nthu.edu.tw/),   
where I was advised by Dr. [Yi-Hsuan Yang](https://affige.github.io/).     
I've met with many incredible people and worked on exciting projects along the journey.   
For more details, feel free to check out my [slides introducing my work experience](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yQgeV4nE4nXBTuv4hxB11M_98OYn6chD7o9HGma7WAE/edit?usp=sharing).
