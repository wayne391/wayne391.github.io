Hi! I’m Wen-Yi Hsiao (wayne391), currently a Senior Research Engineer at Taiwan AILabs.

I specialize in Multimedia Research and Engineering, focusing on Music, Audio, Digital Signal Processing (DSP), and Computer Vision.    
As a researcher, I've published over 10 papers with more than 1,000 citations.  
As an engineer, I’ve contributed several tools to the community, earning over 2,500 stars on GitHub.  

I hold both a B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Computer Science from [National Tsing Hua University](https://www.nthu.edu.tw/), where I was advised by Dr. [Yi-Hsuan Yang](https://affige.github.io/). Throughout my journey, I've collaborated with many incredible people and worked on exciting projects. 

The topics I've engaged include:
* Music Generation
* Music Understanding
* Audio Effect Modeling
For more details, feel free to check out my [slides introducing my work experience](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yQgeV4nE4nXBTuv4hxB11M_98OYn6chD7o9HGma7WAE/edit?usp=sharing).


Outside of work, I enjoy developing DSP plugins, 3D modeling, and playing the piano.
I love jazz and contemporary music. My favorite bands/musicians (from old to new) are Bach, Beethoven, Nikolai Kapusin, Scriabin, Herbie Hancock and Snarky Puppy.

***I’m currently exploring new challenges and possibilities!***
Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss new ideas, job opportunities, or potential collaborations.
