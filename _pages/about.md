Hi! I’m Wen-Yi Hsiao (wayne391).

I specialize in Multimedia Research and Engineering.   
Specifically, they are **Music, Audio, Digital Signal Processing, and Computer Vision**.    
* As a **Researcher**, I've published over **10** [publications]() with more than **1.1k** citations.  
* As an **Engineer**, I’ve contributed several [projects]() to GitHub, earning over **2.5k** stars.  

I received my **B.S.** & **M.S.** in **Computer Science** from [National Tsing Hua University](https://www.nthu.edu.tw/),   
where I was advised by **[Dr. Yi-Hsuan Yang](https://affige.github.io/)**.     

I've met many amazing people and worked on many exciting projects along the journey.   
For more details, feel free to check out my [slides introducing my work experience](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yQgeV4nE4nXBTuv4hxB11M_98OYn6chD7o9HGma7WAE/edit?usp=sharing).
